{"prompt": "Context:\nCell biology is the study of cell structure and function, based on the concept that the cell is the fundamental unit of lifenature.com. In other words, all living organisms are made of cells, and understanding cells helps us understand the larger structures (tissues, organs, organisms) that cells compose. Some organisms (like bacteria or yeast) consist of a single cell, while others (like plants and animals) have trillions of cells working together. By focusing on cells, biologists gain insight into how life operates at the most basic level, from general properties shared by all cells to the unique functions of specialized cell types. Cell biology overlaps with many areas of biology, including genetics, biochemistry, and molecular biology, and it provides foundational knowledge for topics such as physiology, medicine, and biotechnology.\n\nHistorical context:The discovery of cells was made possible by the invention of microscopes. In 1665, Robert Hooke observed cell-like compartments in cork tissue, coining the term \"cells.\" Soon after, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed living cells (like bacteria and protists) under his microscopesnature.com.
